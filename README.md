# Personal Website

This is the source code for my [personal portfolio website](https://eduvedras.github.io/Personal-Website/). It showcases some of my projects, skills, and experiences as a developer. The website is built using TypeScript, React, HTML, TailwindCSS and Emailjs and it is deployed on github pages.
